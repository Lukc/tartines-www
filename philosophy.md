% Tartines’ philosophy

  1.

    ### If you try to have fun, you might become productive!

    We are a friendly community. We’re here to make the world or ourselves
    better.

    If you try to do things that you find fun, you might be willing to spend
    more time and effort into it and get better results!

    ### Systems which eat items quickly are fed more items. Slow systems starve. <!-- James Somers -->

    Doing something often will slowly make you better at doing it.

    Barely doing it will make you stagnantly bad at it.

    We’d better be active and all become better at what we do, so that we
    can in turn help others to become good at it.

    ### If you are trying to build a SWAT team, don’t bring in a traffic cop. <!-- Donnie Berkholz -->

    Don’t waste your time bringing people who’re not fit for the job.
    You’ll waste your time, and you’ll waste theirs.

    ### Natsu is dead, but Fuyu lives in its name.

    Our servers, computers and other devices usually have names to easily
    distinguish them. Real names. Not numbers or IDs.

    You’re probably used to this, but if it looks like we’re talking about
    someone, maybe we’re actually talking about something.

    Natsu and Fuyu were both servers we loved and cherished. May them Rest
    in Pieces.

    ### A fool only learns from his own mistakes. The wise man learns from the mistakes of others.

    Try to keep a history of what you do. If something goes wrong, people
    attempting to do the same thing in the future might be able to avoid
    your failures.

    Similarly, try to learn from the people who worked on the same projects.
    You’ll probably be able to do better that way!
