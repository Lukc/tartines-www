Tartinesâ€™ members usually discuss through an online chat network called Jabber.

Our room is at <a href="xmpp:tartines@conference.vinilox.eu?join">tartines@conference.vinilox.eu</a>.

Although everyone may join, this is still a private channel, and you may be
asked to leave at any point until you become a permanent member. Try not to
make a bad first impression!
