Tartines is a **guild** of *philosophers* and *technology enthusiasts*.

In other words, it is a group of *people* that have little to nothing in common, helping each other out to achieve various *personal or collective objectives*.

---

Our **Culture** is in great part built upon the spread of *information technologies* and of *[Libre Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software)*.
We strongly believe that technology can be used for noble purposes, such as granting everyone an unlimited access to *knowledge* or allowing *decentralization* of resources to happen.

Of course, not all of us are computer scientists or developers.
We also include lawyers, pharmacists, mathematicians, as well as people from various other domains.

---

We actively try to **promote** *Libre Software* and *peer-to-peer education*, but we are interested in many other topics, such as *democracy*, *self-management* or the *Open Data* movement.
